# TS-405 — Judgment Export Lock-In

## Type

Strategic (Tier 10 — Strategic Endgame, Optional, Powerful)

## Priority

P4

## Epic

Platform

## Goal

Ensure ETE's value compounds inside the firm by enabling exports that protect proprietary judgment assets.

## Description

Allow export of:

- Outcomes
- Activity
- Summaries

Explicitly exclude export of full judgment models, tradeoff logic, and confidence calibration history. The intent is IP protection by design, not hostile lock-in.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear data boundaries between exportable outputs and protected judgment IP.
- Transparent documentation that explains what is exportable and what remains internal.
- No disruption to ATS portability for permitted outputs.
