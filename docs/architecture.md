# Architecture and Internal References

This folder collects internal guides that document how we build and operate EAT. Use these as entry points when adding new features or patterns.

- [Deployment health](./deployment-health.md) — guidance for monitoring releases and responding to incidents.
- [Marketplace scoring](./msa-scoring.md) — overview of the MSA scoring model and its inputs.
- [TanStack Table usage](./tables.md) — how we structure tables with TanStack Table, the `EATTable` abstraction, and testing patterns.
