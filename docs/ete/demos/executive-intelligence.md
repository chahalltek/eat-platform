# Demo Script: Executive Intelligence (10 minutes)

**Audience:** Business leaders, delivery executives, revenue leaders

**Objective:** Show how ETE provides portfolio-level visibility and confident calls-to-action for at-risk requisitions.

## Minute-by-Minute Flow
1. **00:00–01:00 | Context & login**
   - Open the Executive Portal homepage.
   - Frame: "This is the same data your teams maintain—now with intelligence layered on top."
2. **01:00–03:00 | Risk heatmap**
   - Navigate to the risk heatmap. Point to the color scale and explain how risk is derived (pipeline health, fill velocity, falloffs).
   - Call out one region or business unit that is trending high risk.
3. **03:00–05:00 | Forecasts**
   - Switch to the forecast view for the current quarter.
   - Highlight the forecasted fills vs. target and note confidence intervals.
   - Say: "This forecasts outcomes based on your live Bullhorn data—no manual spreadsheet needed."
4. **05:00–07:00 | Benchmarks**
   - Open benchmarks for similar roles/regions.
   - Compare a lagging req to benchmark fill time and submittal quality.
   - Emphasize the intelligence angle: "ETE shows where we’re off-track and why."
5. **07:00–09:00 | Copilot Q&A**
   - Ask Copilot: "Which reqs are most at risk this quarter?"
   - Walk through the response, pointing to how it cites risk factors and confidence.
   - If time, ask: "What levers improve these by 10%?" to show guided actions.
6. **09:00–10:00 | Close**
   - Recap: "ETE surfaces risk, forecasts outcomes, and benchmarks performance—so you can intervene early without changing tools."

## Suggested Talking Points
- "This is your Bullhorn data enhanced with intelligence—no new system rollout."
- "Risk heatmap prioritizes where leaders should spend time."
- "Forecasts and benchmarks provide confidence before the quarter ends."
- "Copilot answers executive questions with sourced evidence, not guesses."

## Setup Checklist (Exec-specific)
- Exec Portal user with access to at least two regions or lines of business.
- Heatmap pre-filtered to a meaningful slice (e.g., current quarter, specific vertical).
- Forecasts refreshed within the last 24 hours.
- Benchmarks configured for the roles being discussed.
- Copilot prompt tested once to ensure cached results and quick response.

## Contingency Moves
- If heatmap looks uniformly green, filter to last quarter to reveal variance.
- If benchmarks are sparse, pivot to forecasts and Copilot to maintain the intelligence story.

## Reminders (Bullhorn-safe)
- Avoid calling it an ATS; describe it as intelligence in the Bullhorn workspace.
- Do not promise automation of executive actions—position it as decision support with clear evidence.
