# Demo Script: Recruiter Intelligence (10 minutes)

**Audience:** Recruiters and frontline staffing teams

**Objective:** Show how ETE guides recruiters to better matches—same Bullhorn workflow, higher-quality decisions.

## Minute-by-Minute Flow
1. **00:00–01:00 | Setup & framing**
   - Open the Bullhorn job that was prepared in the checklist.
   - State: "We're still in Bullhorn—no new system to learn. ETE adds intelligence right where you work."
2. **01:00–03:00 | Match quality at a glance**
   - Point to the ETE panel on the job.
   - Highlight the match quality score for the role and say how it reflects job-to-candidate fit.
3. **03:00–05:00 | Confidence & explanation**
   - Click into the top candidate and show the confidence indicator.
   - Read one explanation bullet that references data in Bullhorn (e.g., tenure, skills proximity).
   - Say: "You always know why ETE is recommending someone—no black box."
4. **05:00–07:00 | Shortlist handoff**
   - Open the prebuilt shortlist for the job.
   - Show how the shortlist groups the top 3–5 candidates and next-best options.
   - Emphasize: "This keeps you focused on the best outreach without extra clicks."
5. **07:00–09:00 | Actionable next step**
   - Filter or pin one candidate to show control remains with the recruiter.
   - Mention: "You can still adjust the list—ETE is advisory, not automation."
6. **09:00–10:00 | Close**
   - Recap: "Same workflow, better decisions. Match quality, confidence, and explanations guide you to faster placements."

## Suggested Talking Points
- "ETE lives inside your Bullhorn workspace—no tab switching."
- "Match quality plus confidence means you know which candidates to call first."
- "Explanations are plain language, so you can justify every outreach."
- "Shortlists reduce noise; you keep the final call."

## Copilot Prompt (optional if time)
- "Show me why Candidate A is ranked above Candidate B for this job." (Expect a grounded explanation.)

## Contingency if data is thin
- If match scores look flat, pivot to explanations and shortlist curation to show value.
- If shortlist is empty, run the Copilot prompt above to fill it and narrate the result.

## Reminders (Bullhorn-safe)
- Say "talent system" instead of "ATS."
- Reinforce that ETE augments recruiter judgment; it does not auto-reject or auto-advance candidates.
