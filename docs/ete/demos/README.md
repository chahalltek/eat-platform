# ETE Demo Scripts: Recruiter & Executive Intelligence

These demo scripts are designed so anyone at STRSI can deliver a reliable, Bullhorn-safe end-to-end experience in under 10 minutes per persona. Emphasize **intelligence over automation**—the value is better decisions in the same workflow, not generic process automation.

## Shared Setup Checklist
- Confirm Bullhorn sandbox with active job data and recruiter/executive logins.
- Ensure ETE data sync is healthy (recent refresh) and match models are warmed on at least one open job.
- Load a representative Bullhorn job with 5–15 candidate profiles tied to it.
- Have an ETE shortlist saved for that job to accelerate the reveal.
- Prepare a Copilot session with the most recent forecasts and risk data loaded (no stale screenshots).
- Disable notifications that could expose non-demo data on screen share.

## "Do Not Say" List
- Avoid calling Bullhorn or ETE an "ATS"; use "talent system" or "Bullhorn workspace" instead.
- Do not promise full automation; reinforce that humans stay in control with better intelligence.
- Avoid claiming real-time sync if the environment is batch-based; describe it as "keeps pace with recruiter updates."
- Do not oversell model certainty; use "confidence" and "explanation" language as shown in the UI.

## Talk Track Pillars (use in both demos)
1. **Familiar workflow:** Nothing new to learn—same Bullhorn workspace.
2. **Decision clarity:** Match quality + confidence + explanations.
3. **Actionable shortlist:** Guided next steps, not extra clicks.
4. **Copilot guardrails:** Natural-language questions grounded in governed data.
