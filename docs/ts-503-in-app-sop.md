# TS-503 — In-App SOP (Scannable / Short Version)

- **Type:** UX / Content
- **Priority:** P1
- **Epic:** Enablement

## Goal

- Provide a recruiter-friendly, fast-read SOP view.

## Description

- Condensed, in-app version of the SOP with four focus areas:
  - Key principles
  - Sourcing vs Recruiting responsibilities
  - Decision ownership
  - Where structured decision support is expected
- Keep each section to one screen and favor bullets over paragraphs.

## Key Principles

- Respect candidate and client data; default to least-privilege sharing.
- Keep ATS and intake artifacts current before using automation.
- Treat AI prompts and rankings as advisory; recruiters stay accountable.
- Capture rationale for moves so downstream reviewers can audit quickly.

## Sourcing vs Recruiting Responsibilities

- **Sourcing:** build and refresh pipeline, dedupe records, apply must-have filters, tag outreach priority, and surface profile risks or blockers.
- **Recruiting:** run screens, qualify with hiring criteria, drive interview flow, collect feedback, and escalate tradeoffs or compensation flags.
- **Shared:** log decisions in-system, keep candidate comms templates compliant, and close the loop on declines or reassignments.

## Decision Ownership

- Recruiters own shortlist readiness, outreach go/no-go, and interview scheduling.
- Hiring managers own final slate acceptance, role-level tradeoffs, and offer decisions.
- Escalate to leadership when risks affect compliance, DEI commitments, or SLA breaches.

## Structured Decision Support

- Use prescribed playbooks for role families (match scores, confidence, and risk tags).
- Apply structured checklists for offer approvals, counteroffers, and exception requests.
- Rely on in-app prompts for candidate comms; avoid off-platform templates.
- Document deviations from recommendations so trends remain explainable.

## Constraints

- No more than one screen per section.
- Bullet-first; minimize prose.

- [ ] Linked from the full SOP page.
