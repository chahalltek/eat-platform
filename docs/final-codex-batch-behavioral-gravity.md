# Final Codex Batch: Behavioral Gravity & Strategic Moat

**Theme:** Make good judgment the path of least resistance  
**Warning:** These are not flashy. They are sticky.

## Tier 8 — Behavioral Gravity (Very High ROI)

### TS-401 — Decision Friction for Bad Habits
**Type:** UX / Guardrail  
**Priority:** P2  
**Epic:** Platform

**Goal**

Gently slow down poor decision behavior without blocking work.

**Description**

When patterns indicate low-quality decisions (e.g.):

- Very low confidence + submission
- Repeated overrides with no rationale
- Missing intake clarity

ETE introduces **micro-friction**:

- Extra confirmation
- “What’s driving this decision?” prompt
- Suggested pause, not a hard stop

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Friction is contextual, not global
- [ ] Never blocks submission outright
- [ ] Can be disabled per org
- [ ] Logged as part of decision receipt

**Why this matters**

Bullhorn removes friction everywhere. ETE adds it only where judgment matters.
