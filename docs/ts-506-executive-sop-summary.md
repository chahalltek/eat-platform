## Operating Model Snapshot

### Sourcing vs. Recruiting roles

- Sourcing builds the top of the funnel: target lists, outreach, and signal gathering on interest and qualifications.
- Recruiting owns evaluation and conversion: structured screens, stakeholder alignment, offers, and closing.
- Shared success metric: qualified, decision-ready candidates delivered to hiring managers on time.

### Why judgment is structured

- Decisions run on repeatable scorecards to reduce bias, enable comparability, and protect institutional knowledge.
- Roles and skills map to consistent rubrics; deviations require explicit rationale and reviewer sign-off.
- Structured intake + retro loops keep the rubric current with market shifts.

### How AI is used responsibly

- AI accelerates research, drafting, and summarization; humans remain accountable for final decisions.
- Outputs are traceable: prompts and data sources are logged, and risky model behaviors (hallucination, drift) are flagged for review.
- Sensitive data is minimized, access-controlled, and never pushed to external models without approval.

### How Bullhorn and ETE coexist

- Bullhorn remains the system of record for candidate history, compliance artifacts, and hiring-manager communication.
- ETE provides judgment workflows: structured scorecards, calibration, and decision analytics that feed summarized outcomes back to Bullhorn.
- Integration contract: IDs stay consistent, updates are event-driven, and failures default to Bullhorn until reconciled.

### What “good” looks like operationally

- Intake: clear role definition, decision criteria, and SLAs captured before outreach begins.
- Funnel health: sourced candidates meet signal thresholds; conversion between stages is monitored weekly.
- Decision quality: scorecards are complete, rationale is recorded, and exceptions are reviewed within 24 hours.
- Reliability: integrations have dashboards and alerts; playbooks exist for retries, fallbacks, and data corrections.
- Enablement: every team member can explain the workflow, where data lives, and who owns each decision.
